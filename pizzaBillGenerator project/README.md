🍕 Java Pizza Order System.
A simple console-based Java application that simulates a pizza ordering system, built with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This project demonstrates real-world class design using inheritance, encapsulation, and method overriding.
🔧 Technologies & Concepts Used:-
Java – Core Java programming
Object-Oriented Programming
Classes and Objects
Inheritance (DeluxPizza extends Pizza)
Encapsulation (private fields with getters/setters)
Method Overriding
Command Line Interface (CLI) – Console-based input/output
Modular Design – Separate classes for each component
VS Code with Java Extensions – Project structure managed via settings.json
